OOB - Order Of Battle

priorities for this project start with data structure.  if i can't figure out how i'm pulling stuff out of the database, how can i write code around that black hole? I'm sure someone else can, but that someone else isn't me, at least not at this point.

1. Database organization.

2. Create (learn) database transfer methods for python.

3. Create @app.routes for display of specific pages (pH, EC, Temp graphs, etc.).

4. Update @app.route('/settings') to allow adjustments for high/low cautions & warnings, dosing settings (ratios of NPK, CaNO3, MgSO4) and high/low limits, etc.

5. Add ability to send text/email messages when adjustments are made or parameters reach warning state.
